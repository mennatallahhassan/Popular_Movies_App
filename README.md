# Popular_Movies_App
Built a UI that presented the user with a grid of movie posters, allowed users to change sort order, and presented a screen with additional information on the movie selected by the user. Added more information to the movie details view:  Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the YouTube app or a web browser). Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie. Also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection. Optimize the app experience for tablet.
You need to put your api key to be able to run the app in any url in the application
